For the different labs in this course, your instructor has prepared a set of data (kernel images,
kernel configurations, root filesystems and more). Download and extract its tarball from a
terminal:
$ cd
$ wget https://bootlin.com/doc/training/embedded-linux/embedded-linux-labs.tar.xz
$ tar xvf embedded-linux-labs.tar.xz



Update your distribution
To avoid any issue installing packages during the practical labs, you should apply the latest
updates to the packages in your distro:
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt dist-upgrade
You are now ready to start the real practical labs!
